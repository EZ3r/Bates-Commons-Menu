# Bates-Commons-Menu
Authors: Elvis Zhou and Henry Liu

Goal and scope of the project:
This program will help you to automatically print today’s or tomorrow’s Bates Commons Menu in the terminal. Now it will only support and execute with the following url: https://menu.bates.edu/NetNutrition/1 . We plan to keep updating it and support menu customization as well as other functionalities. 


All non-default Python and/or R libraries needed:
	Selenium, WebDriver Manager, BeautifulSoup, PrettyTable, Time (Datetime)

The program also required Google Chrome browser installed on your computer. You can download it from:
https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download



How to install those libraries:

Selenium

In terminal, type “pip install selenium” and make sure it is the updated version

WebDriver Manager

In terminal, type “pip install webdriver-manager and make sure it is the updated version

BeautifulSoup

In terminal, type “pip install beautifulsoup4” and make sure it is the updated version

PrettyTable

In terminal, type “pip install prettytable” and make sure it is the updated version

[time and datetime do not need to be installed manually]



How to execute the software:

In the terminal, type “python dcs211_final.py” to run the software. The software will ask you to type “td” or “tmr” to tell if you want today’s menu or tomorrow’s menu. Then the software will open the website and print the menu as a table automatically. In the process, do not execute any other operations until it prints the result in the terminal window. The whole process will take about 20-30 sec.
